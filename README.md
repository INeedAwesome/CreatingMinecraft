# Creating Minecraft

This is a project about me (trying to) follow [GamesWithGabe's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQP4qSCj1eHMHisDDR4iPzw.) defenitive guide to creating minecraft. 

The big difference is that im using Java and he's using C++. Im not that familiar with C++ so I decided to use Java instead. 
Im not really "copying", instead, he's showing some common OpenGL fuctions to make the program and I learn the functions in Java. 

I'm adding some extra stuff such as a custom logger and settings, used to make the user have some options. Such as FOV, fullscreen, gamma and vsync.
I'm also planning to make another file to make the user experiment with variables usually constant in other programs, such as Z-NEAR and Z-FAR PLANE, and mayyyybe som variables in the shader. If so I'll have a file here on github to restore the shader. 

Feel free to download or whatever you want.
